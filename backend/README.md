## Backend Guidelines and API Reference

The `backend` directory contains a fully functional API Flask application powered with SQLAlchemy ORM. In order to spin
it up successfully, you will need to:

1. Create and Initialize the database
2. Create a virtual environment `venv` folder and install python `requirements`
3. Configure your `.env` file
4. Export `FLASK_APP` so it's available in your virtual environment and run the flask app
5. Run tests

### 1. Create and Initialize database

With postgres running, create a `trivia` database

```angular2html
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using `trivia.sql` file provided. In the `backend` folder, run

```angular2html
psql trivia < trivia.sql
```

### 2. Create virtual environment

Follow python3.7 or latest version to install python in your machine, then run the following command to create a
virtualenv while in your backend folder

```angular2html
python -m venv venv 
```

Activate virtualenv and install dependencies

```angular2html
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure your .env configuration file

You will find `.env.template` in your `backend` folder. Make a copy of the file and rename it to `.env` then open and
fill up the missing configurations with your specific values. Some are already prefilled and should be good enough to
get you started.

### 4. Run flask app

While in your backend folder, run the following commands on your terminal

```angular2html
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=True

flask run
```

You should now see the app running at `http:\\127.0.0.1:5000`

**NB**: If you encounter any error, please search the web.

> View the [Frontend README](../frontend/README.md) for details on how to run the frontend app

### 5. Running Tests
To run tests, while in your backend directory, type:
> pytest test_flaskr.py

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- **Base URL**: The current app is hosted locally at the default flask url `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- **Authentication**: This version does not require any authentication.

### Response Format

The response format is standardized and is the same for both `successful` and `failed` requests.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": ""
}
```

- **success: _bool_** : `true` if the request was successful and `false` otherwise.
- **data: _Any_** : Either `int`, `string`, `list`, `dict` depending on the endpoint. This contains the requested data.
- **status_code: _int_** : The status code of the request. Can be one of `200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 422, 500`
- **message: _string_** : The error message returned when an error response is sent.

**Status Codes**

* 2xx: Successful
* 400: Bad request
* 404: Resource Not Found
* 422: Not Processable

**Sample Failed Response**
