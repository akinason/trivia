## Frontend Guidelines

The `frontend` folder contains a fully functional `react` application. In order to start the application, you will need `node`
and `npm` or `yarn` installed in your machine.

### Installing dependencies
While in your frontend directory, type the following command to install application dependencies
> npm install

When the installations are complete, type the following to start the server
> npm start 

You should now see a running react application at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

Go ahead and have some fun playing the `trivia game`
