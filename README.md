## Trivia APP

A bunch of team members at [Gloxon LLC](https://gloxon.com/) got the idea to hold trivia every Tuesdays and Fridays. The rule was simple,
anyone could add new questions and anyone could answer questions in their preferred category which where displayed to
them randomly and without repetition. The trivia is played and the scores are recorded on the
team's whiteboard. The loser had to buy launch for everyone that day. Cool right? :sneezing_face:

I wish I never played the game, cos I actually bought launch more than any other in the team. :rofl: :rofl:

When we are tired of some questions or if they no longer make sens, we can choose to search and delete them, one at a
time.

### Getting Started

The trivia game runs on a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) backend and a [React](https://reactjs.org/)
frontend. There are two folders in the current directory:

```angular2html
/backend # The flask backend API
/frontend # The React frontend application
```

Specific instructions for running the backend and the frontend are located in their respective README.md files
found in the folders mentioned above.

> * [Frontend Documentation](./frontend/README.md)
> * [Backend Documentation](./backend/README.md)


### My wish for you

I hope you enjoy playing the trivia game with your team. And if you loose like me, don't feel bad paying for the launch.
Life sometimes is not fair. But if you win most of the time, then enjoy your free launch. :rofl:
